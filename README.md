# CopyFiles

The purpose of the program is to copy fast and easily many files, without wasting time. Originally the idea was born because, I make a lot of photos of people on parties etc.
The problem was that when I upload all photos in cloud so people could see them and choose which photos they want, they give me the photo name.
For example person X wants the images: IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0340.jpg and so on. 
When more that ten people want some photos, I have to go in the photos folder and mark each photo for person X, then make a folder: person X.
And this will happen for every single person who wants photos, which waste time managing the photos.
With this program I just write the new folder name I want and then enter the photos name and voil√† work is done faster than scrolling throw all photos and wasting time.
